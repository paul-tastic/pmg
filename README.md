I did this project 2 different ways, both using PHP. 

The first way was a procedural approach, it also involves some robust error checking. The second way was object oriented. I wanted to see how the 2 performed, especially with large files. Interestingly, the OOP solution was faster. And that speed difference became more important as the file size grew. Details are below:  

5 million records: 3 minutes to append the 2 files into a new one  
10 million records: 6 minutes to append the 2 files into a new one  
80 million records (2 x 2.9G files): 53 minutes (procedural), 46 minutes (oop) to append the 2 files into a new one.  

original instructions below:  

# CSV Combiner

Write a command line program that takes several CSV files as arguments. Each CSV
file (found in the `fixtures` directory of this repo) will have the same
columns. Your script should output a new CSV file to `stdout` that contains the
rows from each of the inputs along with an additional column that has the
filename from which the row came (only the file's basename, not the entire path).
Use `filename` as the header for the additional column.

## Input & Output
We will run your code as follows
```
$ ./csv-combiner.php ./fixtures/accessories.csv ./fixtures/clothing.csv > combined.csv
```

However, the CSV files inside the fixtures are not the only files we will run
through. We will run your code through files > 2 GB to see if you hit memory limits.

## Example

Given two input files named `clothing.csv` and `accessories.csv`.
